name: persist-everywhere
description: Broadcast a fact, rule, or preference to ALL of the user's knowledge surfaces at once — their knowledge base, auto-memory, global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md, and (when project-relevant) project CLAUDE.md files. Use when the user says "add this to the brain", "add to memory", "add to claude.md", "add to all the claude mds", "persist this everywhere", or "save this in all places".

# Persist Everywhere

Take the fact/rule/preference from the conversation (the thing the user just said "add this" about — if ambiguous, the most recent decision or correction discussed) and write it to every applicable surface in one pass. One canonical deep copy; everything else is a pointer or condensed restatement. Never paste the same full text into four places — that guarantees drift.

## Surfaces and what goes where

1. **Knowledge base (canonical copy)** — the user's structured notes system, if they have one (an Obsidian vault, OKF bundle, wiki directory — check memory/CLAUDE.md for where it lives). Find the existing concept/note that covers the topic and UPDATE it; do not create a duplicate. Append a dated one-liner to the base's changelog if it keeps one. If the user has no knowledge base, the memory directory is the canonical copy instead.
2. **Global CLAUDE.md** — `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Only for cross-project working rules (how the agent should behave everywhere). If the file is an index of pointer one-liners (see the slim-claude-md skill), add/update the one-liner AND the detail file it points to. If a section on the topic exists, edit it instead of appending a new one.
3. **Auto-memory** — the session's memory directory. One file per fact with the standard frontmatter, plus a one-line pointer in `MEMORY.md`. Update an existing memory file if one covers the topic; delete memories the new fact contradicts.
4. **Project CLAUDE.md(s)** — only when the user explicitly says "all the claude mds" or the fact is project-specific. Default to the current repo's CLAUDE.md; ask before touching other repos' checked-in CLAUDE.md files (team-visible, needs a commit to ship).

## Rules

- **Verdict gate before any write** — run this checklist first and state the verdict in one line:
  1. Grep existing coverage: the knowledge base, memory index + files, rules, and existing skills.
  2. Decide scope: cross-project rule vs project-only vs domain.
  3. Verdict: **Save** (new — write it) · **Improve** (existing entry stale/partial — update in place) · **Absorb** (belongs inside an existing rule/concept — merge, no new file) · **Drop** (already fully covered — write nothing, point to the existing coverage).
  Only Save/Improve/Absorb proceed; Drop ends the skill.
- **Dedupe before writing**: on every surface, search for existing coverage first; edit in place rather than appending a second copy.
- **Condense per surface**: knowledge base gets the full reasoning; CLAUDE.md gets the actionable rule; memory gets fact + why + how-to-apply; project CLAUDE.md gets only the project-relevant slice.
- **Cross-link**: each copy names where the canonical copy lives.
- **Report back** one line per surface: `surface — file — created/updated/skipped(reason)`.
- Skip a surface (and say so) when the fact doesn't belong there.
- Checked-in project CLAUDE.md edits are working-tree only; never commit/push without an explicit ask.
